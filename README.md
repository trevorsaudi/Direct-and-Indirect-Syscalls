# Direct-and-Indirect-Syscalls

- This repo contains implementations of Direct and Indirect Syscalls and Reimplementations of various process injection techniques using Indirect Syscalls
- Also Included an NTAPI implementation of vanilla process injection as the syscall examples build upon that.

## [DirectSyscalls](https://github.com/trevorsaudi/Direct-and-Indirect-Syscalls/tree/main/DirectSyscalls)

- Performing Direct Syscalls

## [InDirectSyscalls](https://github.com/trevorsaudi/Direct-and-Indirect-Syscalls/tree/main/IndirectSyscalls)

- Performing InDirect Syscalls

## [Remote Mapping Injection - Indirect Syscalls](https://github.com/trevorsaudi/Direct-and-Indirect-Syscalls/tree/main/LocalMapping-Indirect)

## [NTAPI Injection](https://github.com/trevorsaudi/Direct-and-Indirect-Syscalls/tree/main/NTAPIInjection)

- In this example we encrypt the payload using TinyAES, a small portable AES256 encryption wrapper to implement aes encryption.
